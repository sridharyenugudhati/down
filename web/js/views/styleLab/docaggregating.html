<p>In the aggregating SCSS file you import the files that make up your theme. Note that the order in the aggregating file is important.
</p>
<ol>
    <li class="oj-sm-margin-2x-bottom"><span class="oj-typography-body-md">server side variables settings file:</span> 
                This settings file is where you can customize server side variables. 
                Due to the way <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variable_defaults_">sass default</a> works, 
                the file where you cusomize server side variables must be imported before the 
                JET platform file.</li>
    <li class="oj-sm-margin-2x-bottom"><span class="oj-typography-body-md">JET platform file</span></li> 
    <li class="oj-sm-margin-2x-bottom"><span class="oj-typography-body-md">CSS variables settings file:</span> 
                This settings file is where you can customize CSS variables. </li>
