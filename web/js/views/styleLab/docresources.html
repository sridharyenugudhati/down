<p>General theming information is available in the <a target='_blank'
        href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=jet1510&id=JETDG268">theming developer guide chapter</a>, 
  For the most part JET uses CSS custom properties, 
  aka <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/css-variables-why-should-you-care">CSS Variables</a>.
  However there are some variables that still need to be resolved on the server and use the '$' SASS syntax.</p>
