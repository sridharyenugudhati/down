<h3 class="oj-header-border">Variables</h3>
<p>This section shows the variable values in the currently selected theme.
    Note that these are the derived values that end up in the css. In the variable file, a
	variable will often point to or be derived from another variable.</p>
<p>
    The 'Palette' section shows the color palette of the theme, and other color variables usually point to a palette variable.
    Non-palette variables are (imperfectly) grouped to correspond to the 
    categories in the components area: controls, layout and navigation, forms, collections, and visualizations.</p>
