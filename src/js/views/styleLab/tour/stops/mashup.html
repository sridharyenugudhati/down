<h3 class="oj-header-border">Components or Variables</h3>
<p>This section shows either components or variables depending on what's selected under 'View Selection'. The components area has at least one example of each component to show the effect of the selected theme. Use the top tabs to control which category of components to focus on.</p>
<p>Under 'Variables' section shows the variable values in the currently selected theme. Note that these are the derived values that end up in the css. In the variable file, a variable will often point to or be derived from another variable.</p>
